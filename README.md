# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
The importance of this type of research in the telecom market is to help companies make more profit. It has become known that predicting churn is one of the most important sources of income to telecom companies. Hence, this research aimed to build a system that predicts the churn of customers in  telecom company. These prediction models need to achieve high AUC values. To test and train the model, the sample data is divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. We have applied feature engineering, effective feature transformation and selection approach to make the features ready for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we encountered another problem: the data was not balanced. This problem was solved by Oversampling or using trees algorithms not affected by this problem. These algorithms are Logistic Regression , Random Forest, KNN classifier , and XGBOOST algorithm.
